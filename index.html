Welcome, my name's Max.
<br><br>
Professionally I'm a data science and machine learning engineer with a background in economics. 

Otherwise I'm consumed with betterment and exploration: spontaneous orders, emotion, handspring double front flips, communities on Twitter, writing, and discovering how to best be in the world. The internet is amazing. Here's my slice of it. 
<br><br>
• You can learn a little <a href="/about/">about me</a><br>
• About some of the <a href="/machine-learning/">work I've done</a><br>
• And the people <a href="/interviews">I've interviewed.</a><br>
