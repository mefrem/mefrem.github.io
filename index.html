I'm an executive and full-spectrum life coach based in Austin, TX. <br><br>

Before that I was a software developer, founder, and gymnast. I'm an extrovert, a <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-2/">type-2 Enneagram</a>, and devotee of a number of spiritual and transformational practices. 

<br><br>
The internet's amazing. Here's my slice of it.<br>
• Learn a little <a href="/about/">about me</a><br>
• See what I'm doing <a href="/now/">now</a><br>
<!--
• Some of the things <a href="/coaching/">I do professionally</a><br>
• I'm an <a href="https://calendly.com/maxim-efremov/complimentary-session-max">executive coach</a><br>
• And the people <a href="/interviews">I've interviewed</a><br>
-->
