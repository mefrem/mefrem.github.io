## Current Projects

- [*SanctionsExplorer*](https://master.d2lar62teu450l.amplifyapp.com/) is a continuously updated, web-scraping database and search service providing information pertaining to internationally sanctioned individuals and their known co-conspirators, information spread across hundreds of goverment databases and unstructured reports from dozens of authorizing sources like the United States, US Treasury, UN, and European Union. Served in a technical consultant role for the national security think tank the [Center for Advanced Defense Studies](https://c4ads.org/)
- A mapping tool of my neighborhood's informal network of shared security camera locations. The network was featured in the *Baltimore Sun*: ["This Baltimore neighborhood has built an informal home camera network to fight crime. Police say itâ€™s working."](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-cr-patterson-park-cameras-20191021-wng33b54ffe55ikbxt2arrxmka-story.html)

## Learned Machines, Trained Models

- ["Credit Scoring the Unbanked Population in Vietnam"](https://creditscoring-unbanked-vietnam.herokuapp.com/): Given that nearly 70% of Vietnam's population has never used formal financial institutions and therefore have no credit history, how do we gauge creditworthiness for new small-dollar loan applicants? I built a credit-scoring model for such thin-credit history loan applicants from a banking institution in Vietnam (Note: dormant application; load time up to 30 seconds.)
- [Pic-Metric (Github)](https://github.com/Build-Week-Pic-Metric-2/DataScience): Batch-user-image object detection and classification web application
- [Spotify Song Recommender (Github)](https://github.com/Build-Week-Spotify-Song-Suggester-1/Data-science): K-nearest neighbor model recommends thirty new Spotify songs given a user's input of a single song based upon features such as tempo, acousticness, etc.
