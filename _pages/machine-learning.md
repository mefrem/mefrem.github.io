## Learned Machines, Trained Models

- ["Pic-Metric" (Github)](https://github.com/Build-Week-Pic-Metric-2/DataScience): Batch-user-image object detection web application. Three cutting-edge computer vision models classify objects in users' uploaded images ([Github]())
- ["Spotify Song Recommender" (Github)](https://github.com/Build-Week-Spotify-Song-Suggester-1/Data-science): K-nearest neighbor model recommends thirty new Spotify songs given a user's input of a single song based upon features such as tempo, acousticness, etc. 
- ["Credit Scoring the Unbanked Population in Vietnam"](https://creditscoring-unbanked-vietnam.herokuapp.com/): Given that nearly 70% of Vietnam's population has never used formal financial institutions and therefore have no credit history, how do we guage creditworthiness for new loan applicants?
