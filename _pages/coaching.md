## Maximize

I primarily consult and coach clients on the crypto economy: on-boarding funds, yield farming, liquidity providing, project valuations, etc. I have provided services to those spanning the range of experience and familiarity—from complete newcomers to high net worth individuals with traditional investment experience. My services include:

- Free consultation: [book session here](https://calendly.com/maxim-efremov/15min)
- Hourly consulting at $250 an hour: [book an hour here](https://calendly.com/maxim-efremov/60min?month=2021-05)
- Half-day strategy session: Email me at maxim.efremov@gmail.com

<!-- By dint of the non-traditional path I've taken, I've come into a lot of experiences:

- uprooting and moving to the city with the brightest future in America—Austin, Texas—and creating community
- mastering my body, eating habits, and physical training program as an adult gymnast
- changing careers into tech and being accorded a lifechanging income
- quitting my job to pursue a number of business, projects, and ventures
- investing in cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance, and the crypto economy
- owning my sundry emotions, extirpating the shame with which we all leave childhood

I'm coaching, tutoring, and mentoring those seeking and enquiring in these areas. You can [find time on my calendar](https://calendly.com/maxim-efremov/15min) to schedule a free call so we can find out how you could benefit from my service. -->
