## Maximize

[Book a free consultation call with Max.](https://calendly.com/maxim-efremov/15min)

By dint of the non-traditional path I've taken, I've come into a lot of experiences:

- uprooting and moving to the city with the brightest future in America—Austin, Texas—and creating community
- mastering my body, eating habits, and physical training program as an adult gymnast
- changing careers into tech and being accorded a lifechanging income
- quitting my job to pursue a number of business, projects, and ventures
- investing in cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance, and the crypto economy
- owning my sundry emotions, extirpating the shame with which we all leave childhood

I'm coaching, tutoring, and mentoring those seeking and enquiring in these areas. You can [find time on my calendar](https://calendly.com/maxim-efremov/15min) to schedule a free call so we can find out how you could benefit from my service.
