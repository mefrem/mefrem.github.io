## Maximize

In addition to gymnastics coaching and training, I primarily consult and coach clients on the crypto economy: getting started, on-boarding funds, sources of return, providing a picture of the investment landscape, risk management, project valuations, etc. I have provided services to those spanning the range of experience and familiarity—from complete newcomers to high net worth individuals with traditional investment backgrounds.

The service typically starts with an assessment of your specific needs, which have historically included: improving your relationship with money, understanding crypto, using DeFi protocols, hedging your investment and crypto ["FOMO"](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fomo), earning safe returns on stablecoins in excess of traditional instruments.

My services include:

- A free consultation: [book session here](https://calendly.com/maxim-efremov/15min)
- Hourly consulting and coaching
- Half-day or more coaching and strategy session: Email me with "Half-day coaching" in the subject line and we can set up a time
- "Max Access" -- direct, ongoing communication with me about your questions, developments, project announcements

+Email me right now at [maxim.efremov@gmail.com](mailto:maxim.efremov@gmail.com) to start planning your coaching session.

<!-- By dint of the non-traditional path I've taken, I've come into a lot of experiences:

- uprooting and moving to the city with the brightest future in America—Austin, Texas—and creating community
- mastering my body, eating habits, and physical training program as an adult gymnast
- changing careers into tech and being accorded a lifechanging income
- quitting my job to pursue a number of business, projects, and ventures
- investing in cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance, and the crypto economy
- owning my sundry emotions, extirpating the shame with which we all leave childhood

I'm coaching, tutoring, and mentoring those seeking and enquiring in these areas. You can [find time on my calendar](https://calendly.com/maxim-efremov/15min) to schedule a free call so we can find out how you could benefit from my service. -->
