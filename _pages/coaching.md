## And Maximize

By dint of the non-traditional path I've taken, I have experience with:

- uprooting and moving to the city with the brightest future in America—Austin, Texas—and creating community
- mastering my body, eating habits, and physical training program
- changing careers into tech and being accorded a lifechanging income
- owning my sundry emotions, extirpating the shame with which we all leave childhood
- approaching strangers, making friends
- leveling up skills, habits, feats of strength; from handstand push-ups to software development
