## Max Yields

Most of the time, I teach crypto: from on-boarding funds, to DeFi, yield farming, project valuations and risk management, etc. I've coached complete newcomers, high net worth individuals, and business owners.

The service typically starts with an assessment of your specific needs, which have historically included: personal finance, using DeFi protocols, hedging your investment and crypto FOMO, earning high returns on stablecoins in excess of traditional finance.

My services include:

- Hourly consulting and coaching: [Email link](mailto:maxim.efremov@gmail.com) to discuss or book a session for $500 an hour
- Half-day or more in-person coaching and strategy session: [Email link](mailto:maxim.efremov@gmail.com) with "Half-day coaching" in the subject line to discuss a time and place
- Digital and cohort-based courses over at [MaxYields.io](https://maxyields.io)

## Personal Development

I've also coached and facilitated transformational personal development. My client and student successes include 

- discovering self-disipline and organization
- changing careers, professions, roles, obtaining promotions
- overcoming years of sexual abuse
- reworking the ongoing, internal conversations we have from fear to empowerment

Note that I am not a licensed therapist. My services are leadership support for already well-functioning people who are looking for more.

If you're intersted, I'm coaching, tutoring, and mentoring those seeking and enquiring in these areas. You can [email me](mailto:maxim.efremov@gmail.com) to learn more.
