I'm a gymnast, spontaneous handstander and pushupper, fizeek poaster hovering at 11% bodyfat and shooting for 6%. I can't speak highly enough of the benefits of strength training and mobility: the coordination, confidence, presence it imbues, low resting heart rate, the 'mirin looks. Check out the [fitness instagram](https://www.instagram.com/maximally.me/) to see what I mean.

For those looking to look and feel good:

- I've solved the problem of motivation by *training for feats of bodyweight strength*—straddle planche, handstand, one-arm pull-ups, muscle-ups, etc. I don't have to drag myself to any gym or gymnastics facility because I'm training for something that looks cool as hell. You can harness that thrill for your benefit.
- I train gymnastics once or twice a week, down from highs of twelve hours a week pre-pandemic in March 2020, sixteen hours a week summer 2019. I typically compete all six men's events.
- After experimenting with many training programs, I'm currently [greasing the groove](https://breakingmuscle.com/fitness/greasing-the-groove-how-to-make-it-work-for-you) with a different exercise every day. That means I set a timer and every 30 minutes to an hour, I get up and do a set of exercises (for instance, five handstand push-ups). Because my rests are an ~hour long, the work is done with near perfect form and muscular recruitment. I calculate that I do as much work over an 8-hour day as I would in a 75-minute session at the gym when you factor in between-set rest periods.
- I lift weight once or twice a week, schedule allowing. I tend towards whole body workouts—arms, legs, push and pull muscle splits, and end with a soak of my metabolic conditioning system (a few kilometer row, Tabata protocols, etc.)
- Nutritionally: I skip breakfasts, fast for 24 hours once a week, eat a de facto low carb diet, high in meats and fruits.
