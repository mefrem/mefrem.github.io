I love writing and explaining things. I think often about unintended consequences, human fallibility, and human ingenuity. You can find more bite-sized ideas on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxefremov).

Apart from [desiging computer programs to solve real-world problems](/machine-learning/), some neat things Iâ€™ve done:

- took a break from college, joined AmeriCorps, and did community service, disaster relief, and trail building all over the country (I recommend it!)
- creatively financed a rental property while a college student
- made lifelong friends on the internet, met them years later
- studied and lived in Seoul, South Korea
- I'm also a gymnast and handbalancer. Check out my [fitness page!](https://www.instagram.com/maximally.me/)
