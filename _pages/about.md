The internet is amazing. Here's my tiny slice of it.

I love explaining things and writing so this website is my training ground. I’m a data scientist studying at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/). I like thinking about unintended consequences, human fallibility, and human ingenuity.

My interests include personal finance, monetary economics, and gymnastics. Some cool things that I’ve done: bought a house with student loans, learned gymnastics as an adult, and lived in Seoul, South Korea. 

I also love to do handstands.
