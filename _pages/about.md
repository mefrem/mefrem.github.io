I love the feeling of understanding something so well that you can explain it in the way that captures what is exciting. I think often about unintended consequences, human fallibility, and human ingenuity. You can find more bite-sized ideas on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxefremov).

Apart from [desiging computer programs to solve real-world problems](/machine-learning/), some neat things about me:

- took a break from college to join AmeriCorps and do community service, disaster relief, and trail building all over the country
- creatively financed a rental property while a college student
- made lifelong friends on the internet who became my irl friends
- studied and lived in Seoul, South Korea
- I discovered the value of meditation and learned that I am not synonymous with my every thought. Two guided meditation apps I'm partial to are Headspace and Waking Up. Email me for a free introductory month of Waking Up!
- I've designed and experimented with dieting and exercise programs since 2014, having settled on an intermittent fasting, caloric-restricted high-carb and protein diet—although lord knows I love to snack
- I'm also a gymnast and handbalancer—check out my [fitness instragram](https://www.instagram.com/maximally.me/)
