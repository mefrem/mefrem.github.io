Hi. I'm Max.

My life exploded in 2020 when I moved to Austin, TX, my favorite city in the world.

<sup><sub>What's being whispered in your ear?</sub></sup>

Around then 1) I lobbied John Cornyn to double legal immigration, a total moonshot (he's settling for DACA), 2) quit my job as a data scientist and machine learning engineer, so that I could 3) invest and consult crypto and web3 full-time. I lead with Austin because my experience has been that if you surround yourself with your heroes and favorite people, life becomes extremely meaningful and good.

My favorite things about me are my warmth and energy, interpersonally relating with super smart, high integrity people. Other people seem to like it, too. 

The best way to get to know me would be to read the site, my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxefremov) and on [Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@mefrem) (lol remember Clubhouse?). See what I'm up to [now](/now/) or take a look at some of [my influences](/influences).

Some salient features:

- [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/index) started a tradition of including your big five personality metrics: I'm through-the-roof extroverted—99th percentile, 62nd on emotional stability, 89th on agreeableness, 80th on conscientiousness, and 91st on imagination according to some 8-minute quiz.
- I've been a part of the [rationalist](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_movement) community since 2013, and consider the movement and some of its members among the most important influences on my life. There's a line from my reading Slate Star Codex to the most important details and results of my life. I also started the Based in Austin meetup—DM if you want to join!
- I spent several years during college doing community service and disaster relief across the American Midwest. I met lots of people and came away with the conviction that people are immensely decent.
- I've had a lifelong interest in our inner world: our personalities and why they are that way; shame, its purpose, its exteripation; the effect of exteneral action on our minds; and internal family systems psychotherapy, psychedelic science and research, and authentic representation and connection
- I'm a gymnast, acrobat, and handbalancer—check out the [fitness gram](https://www.instagram.com/maximally.me/) and [fitness page](/fitness)
