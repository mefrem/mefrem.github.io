The internet is amazing. Here's my slice of it.

I’m a data scientist based on the East Coast. I love writing and explaining things. I think often about unintended consequences, human fallibility, and human ingenuity.

I've been inspired to share some of my ideas after hearing how often the "obvious and mundane" [bears repeating](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/#but-i-don-t-have-anything-original-to-say-and-i-would-be-just-repeating-things-said-elsewhere-on-the-internet) and [why "unoriginal" writing is useful](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/#but-i-don-t-have-anything-original-to-say-and-i-would-be-just-repeating-things-said-elsewhere-on-the-internet). You can find more on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxefremov).

Some neat things that I’ve done:

- took a break between years two and three of my undergraduate degree, joined AmeriCorps, and did community service, disaster relief, and trail building all over the country (I recommend it!)
- made friends on the internet who became my best friends and then finally met them irl
- studied abroad in Seoul, South Korea

I'm also a gymnast and handbalancer.
