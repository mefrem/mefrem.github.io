## **A Life Story in Five Chapters.**

### **Chapter 1: First 20 years - Russians in West Baltimore**
I was born in Baltimore to a 5th-generation Irish Catholic mother and fresh-off-the-boat Russian father. My sister and I were raised in inner-city Baltimore, spending summers in post-Soviet Moscow. The '90s were a Wild West of multiculturalism. Childhood was marked by fun-lovingness, my father's alcoholism, and a latchkey freedom to roam, explore, and adapt, especially with people. Connecting with others virtually exploded once I got online in middle and high school and started meeting up with internet friends I met on forums or Reddit. That later turned into meeting my heroes—[Scott](http://slatestarcodex.com/) [Alexander](https://www.astralcodexten.com/), [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/), and eventually Elon Musk. 

### **Chapter 2: College, dropping out, and getting my hands dirty** 
I went to a state college, got straight As, but dropped out amidst disillusionment with my lack of purpose. I decided to get out of Baltimore and took a tour of national public service, spending my early and mid-twenties getting my hands dirty in a variety of ways—as a team leader in AmeriCorps (a "domestic Peace Corps") to twelve 18-24-year-olds, responding to natural disasters, building hiking trails, traveling the country. These were formative years which gave me a strong sense that bone-deep meaning comes from service, not success. I went back to college at the riper age of 25 for a degree in economics. I picked up gymnastics at this point and started training four hours, five days a week, for nearly five years, and loved every minute of it.

### **Chapter 3: Twitter catapults my life, falling in love with Austin, TX**
While traveling Southeast Asia in 2019, one fateful day I got back onto Twitter. I had no idea how much this would change my life. It was on that site that I discovered [Austen Allred](https://x.com/Austen)'s software bootcamp Lambda School, got my first remote tech job, and, in fall 2020, I visited Austin, Texas to meet a few mutuals, whereupon I fell in love with the city. I moved there two weeks later. I started my first entrepreneurial endeavor with a friend, a cohort-based coaching business that quickly scaled to $30k months, and I was hooked by coaching and business. I started _Based in Austin_, a monthly meetup for contra-woke internet natives that grew to a few hundred members. I started to grow a tech-heavy network, a group of Austin transplants galvanized by Covid. I even met Peter Thiel, who was interested enough in _Based_ to offer funding a venture studio. All of it sparked by Twitter. 

### **Chapter 4: The journey inward**
My world up to this point was heavy left-brain: economics, technology, software development, political philosophy. It took falling in love to awaken the right-brain. My partner was a psychedelic-assisted therapist, and that relationship—and breakup—was what initiated a radical reorganization of my life around new fundamentals of meditation, prayer, emotional fluidity and mastery—by which I mean two years wandering the desert of grief, love, and ego death. I sat nearly three months of meditation retreat, studied under great teachers like [Dustin DiPerna](https://www.esalen.org/faculty/dustin-diperna), [Joe Hudson](https://www.artofaccomplishment.com/about), and [Anurag Gupta](https://youtu.be/hnfKGsGEhQ8?si=kOWWo3zvJNz9anTf), and generally watched my identity disassemble and reassemble in front of my eyes. I learned the transformative power of presence—being seen, challenged, and cared for by those skilled in fearless inquiry and unconditional regard. In early 2024, I launched Max Impact LLC to offer others that same kind of transformational relationship.

### **Chapter 5: Now**
Today I coach driven men—entrepreneurs, leaders, and creatives—who are ready to do the deep inner work that leads to outer impact. My approach is grounded in self-exploration, transformational presence, and my utter conviction of your greatness. The results are wholeness, clarity, and empowerment. When I'm not coaching, I'm training gymnastics or hiking around Austin.

I work with high-performing founders and executives to create lives of impact, transformation, and fulfillment.

My approach is grounded in the human system's innate capacity to evolve and transform, with the right ingredients: skillfully attuned presence, unconditional acceptance, fearless reflection, and a conviction of someone's greatness. The results are wholeness, fulfillment, clarity, and empowerment.

Past and present clients include VC-backed founders, a hedge fund manager, and two high school dropouts. My clients have managed billions of dollars and create nine-figure deals. They've started new companies, recovered relationships—from cofounders to spouses—and undergone full-body physical transformations. It's incredible stuff.

My biggest inspirations are Joe Hudson ([check him out](https://www.youtube.com/@ArtofAccomplishment)), trauma-informed somatic work, nervous system regulation, the world of ontological philosophy, and a host of other people, frameworks and methods.

When I'm not coaching, I'm training gymnastics or spending time with friends and family. I keep some of what I write on this website—I hope you enjoy.

Since moving to Austin, TX in 2020, I quit my job as a data scientist and:
1) lobbied John Cornyn to double legal, high-skilled immigration ([thanks to Bryan Caplan](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316960)),
2) started coaching people in crypto in early 2021,
3) started a monthly meetup "Based in Austin" that grew to some two hundred members,
4) have met countless people, Twitter mutuals, intellectual heroes, neighbors and founders and families.

The best way to get to know me would be to read the site, my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxefremov), [Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@mefrem). See what I'm up to [now](/now/) or take a look at an out-of-date-and-incomplete list of [my influences](/influences).

Some salient features:
- [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/index) started a tradition of including your big five personality metrics: I'm 99th percentile extroverted, 62nd on emotional stability, 89th on agreeableness, 80th on conscientiousness, and 91st on imagination/neuroticism.
- I encountered the [rationalist](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_movement) community in 2013, my port of entry to deep internet rabbit holes that end in life-changing friendships. There's a line from my reading Slate Star Codex to me moving to Austin, Texas.
- I spent several years during college doing community service and disaster relief across the American Midwest. I met the salt of the earth and came away with the conviction that people are immensely decent.
- I'm a gymnast, acrobat, and handbalancer—check out the [fitness gram](https://www.instagram.com/maximally.me/) and [fitness page](/fitness).
