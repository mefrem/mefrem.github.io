<h2>I'm Max.</h2>
I'm a community builder based in Austin, TX. I primarily work in crypto as an educator, adviser, and investor. I'm a personal development coach for a leadership & emotional intelligence program. And I'm a gymnast!

<small>Based in Austin, my [based](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=based) monthly meetup.</small>

Since moving to Austin in 2020, I quit my job as a data scientist and machine learning engineer and 1) lobbied John Cornyn to double legal immigration (he's settling for DACA), 2) created a women's only crypto mastermind, 3) started the Based in Austin meetup, a group of builders, entrepreneurs, thinkers, and writers occupied with freedom and human greatness, and 4) have met countless people, Twitter mutuals, intellectual heroes, neighbors and founders and families. I lead off with Austin because my experience has been that right people and the right place takes you anywhere.

The best way to get to know me would be to read the site, my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxefremov) and on [Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@mefrem). See what I'm up to [now](/now/) or take a look at some of [my influences](/influences).

Some salient features:

- [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/index) started a tradition of including your big five personality metrics: I'm through-the-roof extroverted—99th + percentile, 62nd on emotional stability, 89th on agreeableness, 80th on conscientiousness, and 91st on imagination according to some 8-minute quiz.
- I've been a part of the [rationalist](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_movement) community since 2013, and consider the movement and some of its members among the most important influences on my life. There's a line from my reading Slate Star Codex to the most important details and results of my life.
- I spent several years during college doing community service and disaster relief across the American Midwest. I met lots of people and came away with the conviction that people are immensely decent.
- I've had a lifelong interest in our inner world: our personalities and why they are that way; shame, its purpose, its exteripation; the effect of exteneral action on our minds; and internal family systems psychotherapy, psychedelic science and research, and authentic representation and connection; hence my interest in transformational personal development
- I'm a gymnast, acrobat, and handbalancer—check out the [fitness gram](https://www.instagram.com/maximally.me/) and [fitness page](/fitness)
