[Graham Duncan](https://grahamduncan.blog/about/) has one of my favorite About Me pages, so I took his inspiration and laid out:

# **A Life Story in Five Chapters**

## **Chapter 1: First 20 years - Russians in West Baltimore**
I was born in Baltimore to a 5th-generation Irish Catholic mother and fresh-off-the-boat Russian father. My sister and I grew up in the 90s, a Wild West biculturalism of inner-city Baltimore and summers in post-Soviet Moscow, Russia. Childhood was marked by fun-lovingness, a chaos that we took as totally normal, and a latchkey freedom to roam, explore, and adapt. Connecting with others took on an otherworldly dimension once I got on the internet in middle school and started meeting with internet friends I met on forums and random websites. That later turned into meeting my heroes—[Scott](http://slatestarcodex.com/) [Alexander](https://www.astralcodexten.com/), [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/), and eventually Elon Musk! This cemented the internet as a wildly underrated serendipity engine that rewards curiosity and authenticity. 

## **Chapter 2: College, dropping out, and getting my hands dirty** 
I went to a nearby college, did well enough, but dropped out in the middle of my fifth semester amidst disillusionment with the lack of clarity I had about my purpose. I was 20 years old and I didn't know what I wanted to do, let alone major in, and parties were a lot more fun in the meanwhile. I knew I couldn't do that forever, though. My mother had taken me to a Habitat for Humanity build day in high school, and I remembered loving it. In the middle of my aimlessness, I decided to get out of Baltimore and take a tour of national public service. I'm not sure who benefited more, the beneficiaries or me. The structured environment was a welcome change of pace—early to bed, early to rise building homes and hiking trails across the midwest, and every other concievable kind of volunteering from 2014-2016. I went back to college at the riper age of 25 and majored in economics. College with more executive function *ruled*. I exceled, became best friends with my professors, and picked up gymnastics—the latter development turning into a complete obsession, peaking at 20/hour/week training schedule for nearly five years. I loved every minute of it.

## **Chapter 3: Twitter catapults my life, a visit to Austin**
Near the end of college, on a semester abroad in Korea, there was a fateful day I logged back onto Twitter. I had no idea how much this would change my life. It was on that site that, among many other things, I discovered [Austen Allred](https://x.com/Austen)'s software bootcamp Lambda School, got my first remote tech job, and, in fall 2020, I visited Austin, Texas to meet a few mutual followers, whereupon I fell in deeply in love with the city. Two weeks later, I moved there. 6 months later, I quit my job to start my first entrepreneurial endeavor, a cohort-based coaching platform. I then started _Based in Austin_, a monthly meetup that grew from 5 people at the first meetup to a few hundred members that met every month. All because of Twitter! 

## **Chapter 4: The journey inside**
My world up to this point was heavy left-brain: economics, technology, software development, political philosophy. It took falling in love—and experiencing the most painful breakup—to awaken the right-brain. The pain and confusion of the heartbreak was so thorough and excruciating that it initiated a radical reorganization of my life around the fundamentals of meditation and prayer. I sought retreat, met my teachers [Dustin DiPerna](https://www.esalen.org/faculty/dustin-diperna), [Joe Hudson](https://www.artofaccomplishment.com/about), and [Anurag Gupta](https://youtu.be/hnfKGsGEhQ8?si=kOWWo3zvJNz9anTf), and generally watched—often helpless and horror-stricken—at the depth of unresolved childhood wounds running my adult body. I learned the transformative power of presence; came to believe, like Joe has said, that the scarcest, most precious quantity is attuned, loving presence. In early 2024, I launched Max Impact, a coaching practice founded on the view that I could add some measure of that quantity to the world. I worked as hard as I could at that project. The irony is that I was the one needing that kind of presence, trying to manifest it by giving it away. The depths to which we are full of it is truly profound!

## **Chapter 5: Now**
In fall 2025, I relented on the coaching practice to create space for the latest adventure: [Gauntlet](https://gauntletai.com/)—a 10 week, 100-hour-a-week immersive bootcamp for AI-assisted software development. I'm about halfway through, and took time during Thanksgiving to give thanks to this wild opportunity—a Hogwarts of AI magic with a little dose of the 'tism—to equip me for the next chapter of my life. Thanks for reading.

I work with high-performing founders and executives to create lives of impact, transformation, and fulfillment.

My approach is grounded in the human system's innate capacity to evolve and transform, with the right ingredients: skillfully attuned presence, unconditional acceptance, fearless reflection, and a conviction of someone's greatness. The results are wholeness, fulfillment, clarity, and empowerment.

Past and present clients include VC-backed founders, a hedge fund manager, and two high school dropouts. My clients have managed billions of dollars and create nine-figure deals. They've started new companies, recovered relationships—from cofounders to spouses—and undergone full-body physical transformations. It's incredible stuff.

My biggest inspirations are Joe Hudson ([check him out](https://www.youtube.com/@ArtofAccomplishment)), trauma-informed somatic work, nervous system regulation, the world of ontological philosophy, and a host of other people, frameworks and methods.

When I'm not coaching, I'm training gymnastics or spending time with friends and family. I keep some of what I write on this website—I hope you enjoy.

Since moving to Austin, TX in 2020, I quit my job as a data scientist and:
1) lobbied John Cornyn to double legal, high-skilled immigration ([thanks to Bryan Caplan](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316960)),
2) started coaching people in crypto in early 2021,
3) started a monthly meetup "Based in Austin" that grew to some two hundred members,
4) have met countless people, Twitter mutuals, intellectual heroes, neighbors and founders and families.

The best way to get to know me would be to read the site, my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxefremov), [Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@mefrem). See what I'm up to [now](/now/) or take a look at an out-of-date-and-incomplete list of [my influences](/influences).

Some salient features:
- [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/index) started a tradition of including your big five personality metrics: I'm 99th percentile extroverted, 62nd on emotional stability, 89th on agreeableness, 80th on conscientiousness, and 91st on imagination/neuroticism.
- I encountered the [rationalist](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_movement) community in 2013, my port of entry to deep internet rabbit holes that end in life-changing friendships. There's a line from my reading Slate Star Codex to me moving to Austin, Texas.
- I spent several years during college doing community service and disaster relief across the American Midwest. I met the salt of the earth and came away with the conviction that people are immensely decent.
- I'm a gymnast, acrobat, and handbalancer—check out the [fitness gram](https://www.instagram.com/maximally.me/) and [fitness page](/fitness).
