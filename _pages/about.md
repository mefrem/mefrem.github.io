Besides my census details (Max Efremov, American, male, born in '91), the best way to get to know me would be to read the site, my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxefremov), or email me at [maxim.efremov@gmail.com](mailto:maxim.efremov@gmail.com)—if you're interested by what you've seen here, then I'm sure I'd like to meet you.

Some neat things about me:

- I've been associating with the [Rationlist](https://www.lesswrong.com/) community since 2013, and consider the movement and some of its blogs and thinkers the most important influences of my life
- I spent several years during college doing community service, disaster relief, and trail-building across the American Midwest
- made dozens of lifelong friends on the internet who then became my friends irl
- studied and lived in Seoul, South Korea
- I discovered the value and utility of meditation—you are not your thoughts!—and have been meditating regularly since 2017. I'm partial to the app Waking Up—email me for a free introductory month!
- I've designed and experimented with numerous dieting and exercise programs since 2014, having settled on an intermittent fasting, caloric-restricted, high-protein diet
- I'm a gymnast—check out the [fitness instragram](https://www.instagram.com/maximally.me/)
