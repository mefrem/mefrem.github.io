Hi. I'm Max.

Besides my census details—American, male, born in '91—the best way to get to know me would be to read the site, increasingly my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxefremov), or take a peek at [my influences](/influences). If you're interested by what you've seen here, then I'm sure I'd like to hear from you. I'm bullish about my internet friends.

Some salient features:

- I am extremely extroverted. Gwern started a tradition of including your big five personality metrics: I'm 98th percentile extroverted, 62nd on emotional stability, 89th on agreeableness, 80th on conscientiousness, and 91st on imagination according to some 8-minute quiz. I'm earnest, warm, socially fearless, approachable, curious. Authentic and genuine is a word that comes up a lot.
- I've been a part of the [rationalist](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_movement) community since 2013, and consider the movement and some of its blogs and thinkers among the most important influences on my life. There's a line clear from the grey tribe and blogs like Slate Star Codex to my [up and moving cross country to Austin to be closer to people I met Twitter](/now/)
- I spent several years during college doing community service and disaster relief across the American Midwest. I met lots of people and came away with the confirmation that people are good and immensely decent
- lived in Seoul, South Korea, partied in Gangnam, hiked Seoraksan
- Interested in understanding our inner world: shame, its absence, abundance, internal family systems psychotherapy, psychedelic science and research
- I'm a gymnast! check out the [fitness gram](https://www.instagram.com/maximally.me/) and [fitness page](/fitness) here
