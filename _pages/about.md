**I'm Max Efremov.**

Last updated: 2024-02-01

I'm an <a href="https://calendly.com/maxim-efremov/complimentary-session-max">executive coach</a><br> who works with high impact leaders. Most of my clients are founders and entrepreneurs who want to go deep. Working with me, they awaken to their deepest wisdom, unlocking new levels of growth and accomplishment beyond what they thought possible. 

I keep some of the stuff I write on this website--I hope you enjoy.

Since moving to Austin, TX in 2020, I quit my job as a data scientist and 1) lobbied John Cornyn to double legal, high-skilled immigration ([thanks to Bryan Caplan](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316960)), 2) started coaching people in crypto in early 2021,  3) started a monthly meetup "Based in Austin" that grew to a some two hundred members, 4) have met countless people, Twitter mutuals, intellectual heroes, neighbors and founders and families.

The best way to get to know me would be to read the site, my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxefremov), [Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@mefrem). See what I'm up to [now](/now/) or take a look at an out-of-date-and-incomplete of [my influences](/influences).

Some salient features:

- [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/index) started a tradition of including your big five personality metrics: I'm 99th percentile extroverted, 62nd on emotional stability, 89th on agreeableness, 80th on conscientiousness, and 91st on imagination/neuroticism
- I encountered the [rationalist](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_movement) community in 2013, my port of entry to deep internet rabbit holes that end in life-changing friendships. There's a line from my reading Slate Star Codex to me moving to Austin, Texas
- I spent several years during college doing community service and disaster relief across the American Midwest. I met the salt of the earth and came away with the conviction that people are immensely decent.
- I'm a gymnast, acrobat, and handbalancer—check out the [fitness gram](https://www.instagram.com/maximally.me/) and [fitness page](/fitness) -->
