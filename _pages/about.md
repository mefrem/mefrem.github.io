I love the rush of understanding: the mental clicks, *eurekas*, ["view quakes"](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/11/view-quake-read.html). I think often about unintended consequences, human fallibility, and human ingenuity. You can find bite-sized ideas on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxefremov). My email is [maxim.efremov@gmail.com](mailto:maxim.efremov@gmail.com) and a good place to reach me.

Some things about me:

- I spent several years during college doing community service, disaster relief, and trail-building all over the country
- I creatively financed a rental property while a college student
- made lifelong friends on the internet who then became my best friends irl
- studied and lived in Seoul, South Korea
- I discovered the value of meditation and learned that I am not synonymous with my every thought. I'm partial to the app Waking Up—email me for a free introductory month!
- I've designed and experimented with dieting and exercise programs since 2014, having settled on an intermittent fasting, caloric-restricted, high-protein diet
- I'm a gymnast—check out the [fitness instragram](https://www.instagram.com/maximally.me/)
