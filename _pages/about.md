**I'm Max.**

I live in Austin, work in blockchain, and occasionally host gatherings.

I'm a developer at [Hiro](https://hiro.so/), making the programmable bitcoin economy bigger. I support the [1517 Fund](https://www.1517fund.com/) with community and talent. I'm also a [gymnast](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMxHFo1CjZD/) ðŸ¤¸

I keep some of the stuff I write on this website--enjoy!

Since moving to Austin, TX in 2020, I quit my job as a data scientist and 1) lobbied John Cornyn to double legal, high-skilled immigration ([thanks to Bryan Caplan](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316960)), 2) started coaching people in crypto in early 2021,  3) started a monthly meetup "Based in Austin" that grew to a some two hundred members, 4) have met countless people, Twitter mutuals, intellectual heroes, neighbors and founders and families.

The best way to get to know me would be to read the site, my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxefremov), [Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@mefrem). See what I'm up to [now](/now/) or take a look at an out-of-date-and-incomplete of [my influences](/influences).

Some salient features:

- [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/index) started a tradition of including your big five personality metrics: I'm 99th percentile extroverted, 62nd on emotional stability, 89th on agreeableness, 80th on conscientiousness, and 91st on imagination/neuroticism
- I encountered the [rationalist](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_movement) community in 2013, my port of entry to deep internet rabbit holes that end in life-changing friendships. There's a line from my reading Slate Star Codex to me moving to Austin, Texas
- I spent several years during college doing community service and disaster relief across the American Midwest. I met the salt of the earth and came away with the conviction that people are immensely decent.
- I'm a gymnast, acrobat, and handbalancerâ€”check out the [fitness gram](https://www.instagram.com/maximally.me/) and [fitness page](/fitness) -->
