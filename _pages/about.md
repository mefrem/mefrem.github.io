Besides my census details—American, male, born in '91—the best way to get to know me would be to read the site, my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxefremov), [my influences](http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html) or email me at [maxim.efremov@gmail.com](mailto:maxim.efremov@gmail.com). If you're interested by what you've seen here, then I'm sure I'd like to hear from you.

Some salient features:

- I've been a part of the [Rationalist](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_movement) community since 2013, and consider the movement and some of its blogs and thinkers the most important influences on my life
- I spent several years during college doing community service, disaster relief, and trail-building across the American Midwest
- made dozens of lifelong friends on the internet who then became my friends irl
- studied and lived in Seoul, South Korea
- I discovered in 2017 that you are not your thoughts, and have been meditating regularly ever since. I'm partial to the app Waking Up—email me for a free introductory month!
- I'm a gymnast—check out the [fitness gram](https://www.instagram.com/maximally.me/)
