## April 2021

I lasted six months almost to the day in what could fairly be described as a very good job before I quit.

I was a natural language processing data scientist at a healthcare firm, extracting information from text-based medical records to create a machine-learned data product. It was really fun learning how to solve the problem, but I grew bored iterating more features. It became a struggle to fully show up at my remote job. All the while, the life around me in Austin was *taking off*: an incredible community surrounded me, opportunities for interesting work abounded, and I had caught the bug of crypto investing. Before I knew it, it felt right in my bones to quit, so late February I did.

Right now, I’m working on:

- direct action on and advocacy for immigration reform through *[IDEAL Immigration](https://www.idealimmigration.us/)*, a non-profit. At the intersection of human flourishing, economic growth, and human liberty is *more immigration*. This project is the culmination of my years of study of government interventionism, the conditions for economic growth and human development, and my intellectual collision with [Bryan Caplan](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316960). It was he who introduced me to Steve Kuhn, the founder of *IDEAL*, and Bryan is why I have the opportunity to instantiate what might be currently the most underrated, effective altruist idea there is: more legal immigration.
- adult gymnastics and acrobatics training. Early April saw me on an eight-day *traincation* in Las Vegas. Vegas is home to the world’s best Cirque du Soleil and circus performance acts, so the training facilities are world-class. I traveled with 15 other acrobats, fire spinners, and performers as we contorted, stood on our hands, or otherwise flipped through sin city. Now that I’m back in Austin, I have a number of skills I’m looking to attain, as well as... maybe *model underwear*?
- the crypto economy. Crypto is staggeringly exciting, and shows *immense* promise to change the future. And nothing builds my conviction more than showing people what’s possible. I’ve taken up coaching and tutoring people on the intricacies of the space, and have received astonishingly positive feedback. I’m interested in working in the space more fully as time and progress on all these other ventures allow.

As always, if you’re in Austin, send me a note or [Twitter DM!](https://twitter.com/maxefremov).
