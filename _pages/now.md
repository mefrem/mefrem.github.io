## January 2022

January 19th, 2022 | 12:30pm | Kerby Lane Diner in Austin, TX

It's been 1 year, 3 months, and 24 days since I moved to Austin, Texas.

In that time I attained my [first straddle planche](https://www.instagram.com/p/CL4nDzmF7vD/), started a business, launched two [digital crypto courses](https://maxyields.io), turned 30, met heroes, new friends, made—for me—a ton of money.

I also made every mistake in solopreneuring: Not minding the business _around_ the product, emotion and motivation management, imposter syndrome, and losing virtually all my crypto returns trading. (Being early to a bull market =/= being a good trader.)

I burned out and fell into comparison, lost touch with the most meangingful practices in my life like regular socializing, gymnastics, meditation, and stewed in a lot of "getting left behind" energy.

It's been a *ride*.

In all honesty, it wasn't pretty. I spent some time in the trough of sorrow, with [The Struggle](https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/14/the-struggle/). My [already large appreciation for entrepreneurs](https://twitter.com/maxefremov/status/1479531378672906249) reached new highs. I learned a lot about myself, my strengths and inclincations (I love promotion! Excitement! Sales! Energy!), my disinclinations (staring at a computer not talking to people). I became intimate friends with the committee in my head of know-it-all critics.

I experienced the depths of compassion my friends and family are capable of. Maryna, Rai, Alex, Alan; Nancy, Papa, Sonia; many, many more. Thank you.

As much as the process dejected and humbled me, I have the power to draw any interpretation I want of my experiences. I can choose the more empowering interpretation, such as all this stuff makes me stronger. I can shed the disempowering, like that sharing this qualifies me as incompetent or shameful.

The biggest casualties of this period have been my openness and joy. Which sucks, because I love my openness and joy, a lot. 

So what I'm doing **now** is choosing that. Creating all that incredible joy and excitement, and then giving it away. 

There are a lot of details I'm not clear on right now. For instance, what work I can do that leans on my technical understanding in data science and crypto, but primarily involves my 99th percentile extroversion and people-skills. Or where and with whom I'll live with next. But those details will emerge soon. That's ok.

As always and remember, if you're in Austin, [say hi.](https://twitter.com/maxefremov)

Gramercy.
