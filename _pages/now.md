## January 2022

*January 19th, 2022 | 12:30pm | Kerby Lane Diner in Austin, TX

It's been 1 year, 3 months, and 24 days since I moved to Austin, Texas.

In that time I attained my [first straddle planche](https://www.instagram.com/p/CL4nDzmF7vD/), started a business, launched a [digital crypto course](www.maxyields.io), turned 30, met heroes, new friends, made, for me, a ton of money. I also made every mistake in solopreneuring—not minding the business _around_ the product, emotion and motivation (mis)management, imposter syndrome. I burned out, fell into comparison, lost touch with important practices like meditation and gymnastics, and lost a ton of money (I think I'm the only person early to OHM who didn't make it).

It's been a ride.

In all honesty, it wasn't pretty. I spent some time in the tank, the trough of sorrow, with [The Struggle](https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/14/the-struggle/). My already large appreciation for entrepreneurs has reached new highs. I learned a lot about myself, my strengths and inclincations, my inner committee of know-it-all critics. I learned—let me say, more like am still learning—to love them.

I learned a lot about the depths of compassion my friends and family are capable of. Maryna, Rai, Alex, Alan; Nancy, Papa, Sonia; many, many more. Thank you.

As much as the process smarted, humbled, and dejected me, I have the power to draw any interpretation I want of my experiences. I can choose the more empowering interpretation: This stuff makes me stronger. I can shed the disempowering: That sharing this stuff qualifies me as incompetent and shameful.

The biggest casualties of this period, and my reactions to it, have been my openness and joy. I feel like I took a run so hard at what I wanted that the fall on my face really hurt. Which sucks, because I love my openness and joy, a lot.

So what I'm doing **now** is choosing that. Creating all that incredible joy and excitement, and then living from it. 

There's a lot more in the way of details—for instance, I'm looking for work that leans on my technical understanding in data science and crypto, but leverages primarily my 99th percentile extroversion and people-skills; I'm carefully choosing the community in Austin I want to move-in with next—but those will get shored up in future, and aren't so clear right now. That's ok.

As always and remember, if you're in Austin, [say hi.](https://twitter.com/maxefremov) Gramercy.
