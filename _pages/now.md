**Updated July 5th, 2024**

Writing from my home in Austin, TX, the cicadas buzzing loudly, the summer heat beating me to air conditioning or bodies of water. 

## Cohousing with my closest friends

I've long had the desire to [live next to the people I love most](https://maxefremov.com/cohousing-coliving-why/) while still keeping a place. We would cook together, spontaneously connect, raise our kids together. The dream's been to make it big and live on some kind of commune. Last fall, I noticed something: A handful of friends had moved into apartments at an otherwise nondescript complex in south Austin. Lo and behold, the cohousing dream! Sans the farmsy commune aesthetic. I moved in this spring and now live next to a handful of my closest friends, with more coming this year (my best friend is moving directly next to me; my sister joins in the fall). There's a delight to the spontaneous acts of friendship made so easy by the proximity, and a deep joy as the relationships deepen. And, the whole experiment was a much easier process than I thought it would be! No organizing, just a spontaneous order. 

## Resuming gymnastics

From about the ages of 25 to 30, [I trained gymnastics](https://www.instagram.com/maximally.me/). What started out as a club sport in college turned into an obsession; at one point, I was training 20 hours a week until the pandemic shut down gym facilities. I then moved to Austin and my life became too high an opportunity cost to train as regularly. And with gyms nearby, my practice eventually stopped entirely. Until! I moved this year to a place not far from a gymnastics facility with some drop-in classes. Now I'm back at it.

[I maintain that gymnastics is the best general training stimulus](https://maxefremov.com/why-you-should-do-gymnastics/), with high transfer into other sports, not to mention its rockin' benefits of vitality and physique ([bonus points for rings specialist](https://maxefremov.com/rings-strength/)). I'm glad to see that despite the last few years of diminished practice, I haven't lost everything. I'm curious to see what this new chapter brings.
