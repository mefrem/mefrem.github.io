## January 2024

_Florianopolis, Brazil_

After three of the biggest years of my adult life—coinciding with my moving to Austin—I grew nearly beyond recognition. Current status: molting. 

The most salient features of identity and life shifted right out from under me: the biggest relationship ended; a dream job quit; a home moved out of, personal belongings in storage. A self-understanding now quite totally different. 

If you were to ask me how I'm doing, I'd have trouble answering. Doing well. Really good, even. And beyond my current capacity to explain, much less explain concisely. Experiencing, noticing so much change, challenge, and evolution. And this is for someone who... I mean, it's hard for me provide citations, but I have evolved _so much already in life_. And here I am again, at some new, steeper inflection point. So much is so humbling. So much is so beautiful. A lot of love. Even more letting go. Moving at an unfamiliar pace. Slower? Yea... much slower.

I'm updating this /now page before I head off into the longest break from the internet since 2015, when I lived on a ranch. I'll be on a self-led retreat. Three weeks. The longest retreat I've ever done was ten days. The longest self-led: five. That was two weeks ago. Since then, I quit my job and have only gotten clearer that I want to play with, work with, be played upon and worked upon by the jhānas. 

Because I dropped off from writing on this site before I got into meditation, there is no discussion of it and its relatively newfound centrality to my life (in the last year). Since I did my first [vipassana](https://dhamma.org/) in June, I've cottoned to it like... Well, like a man with many questions unanswered, many problems painfully unsolved, who is offered a view that gives with it the taste of freedom, a taste of salvation. 

I intend to write a bit more about this journey when I return. For now, the best window into understanding _Why jhānas, Why three weeks?_ would be the collection of inspiration and insight from

- [Nick Cammarata's commentary on Twitter...](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Anickcammarata%20jhana&src=typed_query) Seriously, Nick's tweets over the last two years have served as nearly 100% of the genesis of my curiosity and _conviction_, which is that I believe the jhānas are the most easily accessible port of entry to durable happiness independent of conditions. Hence the desire to go explore.

- Check out [Jhourney](https://www.jhourney.io/), a group that facilitates jhāna retreats. Haven't done one of their retreats, but know one of the founders and highly trust him

Looking forward to writing more. Benefiting self and others through writing clearly, helpfully, with a friend in heart: That's you. Thanks for reading.
