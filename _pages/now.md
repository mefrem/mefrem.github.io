## January 2024

_Florianopolis, Brazil_

Current status: molting. Headed off to retreat, looking to explore the jhānas.

- [Nick Cammarata's commentary on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Anickcammarata%20jhana&src=typed_query) has inspired the curiosity particularly about [the jhānas](https://www.lionsroar.com/entering-the-jhanas/)
- [Maija does a breathtaking job summarizing](https://maija-haavisto.medium.com/jh%C4%81nas-as-easily-accessible-insight-practice-everything-you-know-about-meditative-absorptions-2cbe7015a97e) some of the inside baseball as to why the jhānas aren't more popular, given their unique promise, not to mention the Buddha's certification of the jhānas as "the path to Awakening" [(MN 36)](https://suttacentral.net/mn36/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)
