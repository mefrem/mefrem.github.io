## April 2024

_Austin, TX_

Wow. I'm doing it. Walked away from the shiny, the comfortable, the "secure"—high paying job, founding a startup, all during a raging bull market—while trust falling into purpose. I am playful luminosity. I am transformation. I am source of everything. And I'm giving it all away.

Why? Because there's nothing more fulfilling than being in contribution to others. When my ways of being can make the difference in other people's lives... Yea. I can do that forever.
