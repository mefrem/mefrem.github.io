Here is an incomplete list of writers and thinkers I read, admire, or find most interesting.

## Those I owe an eternal debt of gratitude

- [**Scott Alexander**](https://slatestarcodex.com/) - Despite his site being a de facto headquarters of the rationality community, his blog is *still* wildly underrated. His [top posts](https://slatestarcodex.com/about/) are a great place to start. Other pieces that matter to me:
  - [Book Review: Secrets to our Success](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/) - a brilliant exposition of cultural evolution
  - [Asymmetric Weapons Gone Bad](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/06/asymmetric-weapons-gone-bad/) - traditions are stupid, right? And my intuitions as I navigate the terrain only and always tend towards truth?
  - [Book Review: Seeing like a State](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/) - what does it look like from inside a state? 
  - [Cardiologists and Chinese Robbers](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/16/cardiologists-and-chinese-robbers/) - how do we know how bad problems are?
- [**The Last Psychiatrist**](https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/) - a ranting, raving mad psychiatrist going on about narcissim and ignorance
  - [This Is Why The American Dream Is Out Of Reach](https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2010/08/this_is_why_the_american_dream.html)
  - [Hipsters on Food Stamps](https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/11/hipsters_on_food_stamps.html)
- **Howard Baetjer** - my college economics professor, the person who introduced me to the concepts of spontaneous orders, unintended consequences, and opportunity costs ([I interviewed him recently!](/howard-baetjer-economist))

## Those I find myself coming back to again and again

- [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/) explained why you—yes, **you**—should start a blog right now, and is the reason this site exists

- [Tyler Cowen](marginalrevolution.com) is an economist, head of the [George Mason economics department](https://slate.com/culture/2006/03/the-real-secret-of-george-mason-university.html), and along with Alex Tabarrok runs the best economics blog, period. He's prodigious writer, having written some dozen or more books, hundreds of articles and papers, and has blogged daily for decades. He's not one to court controversy or get engaged in the frontlines of the culture war, but he's an ardent student of culture and its effects on human behavior
  - [Stubborn Attachments](https://amzn.to/37F0Ryp)
- [Bryan Caplan](https://www.econlib.org/author/bcaplan/) has made twenty public bets with other academics and journalists since 2007 and has [won every single one](https://www.econlib.org/my-complete-bet-wiki/).

- [Scott Sumner](https://www.themoneyillusion.com) is practically *the* [market monetarist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_monetarism), and has been banging on about nominal GDP targeting for over a decade. We should listen to him.

  - [The Promise of Nominal GDP Targeting](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/sumner-nominal-gdp-primer-mercatus-v1.pdf)

- Matt Levine writes [Money Stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine) the highest signal:noise ratio of any daily newsletter I've ever read, ever.
- [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) is a creative who ventured into tech startups. That experience informed his grandest professional accomplishment: [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/?top100=true), the most famous startup incubator of all time, and his forum [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is where programmers drink their morning coffee. His essays in life, business, and everything in between, are the bedtime stories everyone in Silicon Valley grew up reading

## Those who Tweet

Twitter is the best social media by a mile. There is a community around any interest you could concieve of having an ongoing conversation on things you care about deeply, right now, all the time. Find an account in this scene with a few thousand followers, and live in the comments and reply section of their tweets: Talk to others, be nice, and meet any number of like-minded folks (I mean literally meet!).

## Those more obscure sites I enjoy

- Stack Exchange questions and answers; later I'll upload the *best of* newsletter which contains highly popular answers
  - English Language and Usage
  - The Workplace

- Metafilter, specifically their [most favorited AskMetaFilter site](https://ask.metafilter.com/popular.mefi)
