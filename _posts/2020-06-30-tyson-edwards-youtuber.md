It's not every day that you get to chat with [one of your favorite YouTubers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvBvPuKjUI61O_BtKqVbirw).

Tyson Edwards is one of those all-around incredible athletes: an Olympic weightlifter, gymnastics strength athlete and coach, and most recently a martial artist and marathoner. He's also dabbled in parkour, tricking, climbing, and holds a Guinness World Record in the highest standing backflip.

We discussed the interplay between training and video content creation, the purpose and joy of functional training, Tyson's background in a number of different athletic endeavors, as well his many other interests.

It was a joy to finally get to talk to him.
