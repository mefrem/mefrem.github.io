The novel coronavirus pandemic is a generational shift. A ["narrative collapse"](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/03/09/plot-economics/) the likes of which we have little individual or institutional memory.

Strangely, our duty is not to throw our shoulder behind the wheel of the economy, soldier on to work like the Brits of the Second World War during the monthslong bombing of London. It is instead to stay home. Practice social distancing. Cut off contact with the outside world, while a bare-bones economy provides essentials and develops vaccines and respirators for a valient cadre of healthcare workers.

As constant news of the novel coronavirus rolls in like the error logs of a computer terminal, I find myself glued to screens, every development stimulating a cascade of emotions: an urgency for resolution, anxiousness over the uncertainty, fear for our individual and collective safety and well-being.

It's a potent cocktail for mental anguish.

It's also of dubious value. There is only a limited quantity of actionable, useful information available in the never-ending Twitter stream, traditional journalism outlets, and sundry social media. [And you already know it](https://www.google.com/search?q=coronavirus+tips&fbx=dothefive): wash your hands, mind where you cough, don't touch your face, keep six feet or more distance, and stay home if you can. The important local developments reach you as a matter of course interacting with friends and family.

What happens when we aim the firehose of coronavirus commentary and coverage squarely at our brains? We exhaust our physiology and attention, and deplete the readiness of our most precious and important asset: our minds.

## Mind your Mind

Sam Harris released a [twenty-minute piece of audio](https://samharris.org/podcasts/193-meditation-emergency/) on March 20th that I've been thinking about since I heard it, and has given me strength and clarity.

Please, give it a listen.

Sam admits to having fallen prey to the nonstop energy of coronavirus news. And he realizes that it is getting in the way of his being there in the most helpful way for himself and his family. How much help is chronic anxiety? How helpful is it to have an endocrine system positively soaked in cortisol and adrenaline? While anxiety can be useful, it is dangerous in its extreme.

Learning to understand the limits of anxiety, or any emotion, and restoring yourself to a mindful state, *is a skill that can be trained*. Now is the time for that skill. Moreover, in the space the coronavirus has created in our lives, now is the time to train it.

If you would like a month's free trial of Sam Harris' *Waking Up* app, please [contact me](http://127.0.0.1:4000/about/#contact). I also want you to be aware of [Sam's policy](https://help.wakingup.com/article/54-how-much-does-the-waking-up-course-cost) of providing a free account to anyone who is unable to because they can't afford it.

The utility of a mind well-calibrated to stress is eminently apparent. Why not train for it?
