I've met with a number of instructors, employed engineers, and technical recruiters and one aspect of the job search keeps jumping out to me that likely applies to every industry and career (although I'm writing from the perspective of a data scientist). There is not one set of skills to know but something closer to three: the skills listed in the job description, the skills tested in the interview, and then the actual on-the-job skills. There is a danger in over-optimizing one set at the expense of the others.

For instance, a lot of DS job descriptions are written up by HR departments that think things like Hadoop are still cutting edge big data tools, or that "predictive analytics" is a specific enough description of a skill when the team you may work with might expect things as diverse as improving a dashboard item, creating an inference pipeline, or making data visualizations. This means sometimes checking boxes that may be ultimately "useless" in that you don't use them on the job but would get you binned by an HR department.

The interview is another filter that may be test skills separate from on-the-job competency. It's a point of controversy in tech, but whiteboarding problems are still a popular measure of skill which introduce a lot of noise to the interview: nerves and anxiety around performing under pressure in front of strangers, or their tendency towards algorithms or leetcode problems, which may not be representative of real-world work. Another consideration is the relative ease of administering a SQL quiz at an interview instead of handing off a project for you to spend two weeks to report back on (arguably a much better test of your skills).

What does this all mean? This means that the on-the-job skills you hear about from folks at conferences or real data scientists might not be the skills you should study exclusively for. There are other filters you should be aware of when leveling up and self-studying.

The actionable advice is to:

1) Make a list of skills you have as a part of your education or work history, and a list of skills you want to further develop or learn from scratch while you job search & self-study. Then present that list to employed folks + recruiters you meet and ask for their input, the relative importance/order you should study them in. You may be surprised.
2) You have to acknowledge that interviewers will likely test you on SQL, data structures, algorithms, and other topics adjacent but not exactly *what you'll be doing on the job* because it is expedient to them. Not every hiring team has the bandwidth to administer high-quality interviewing processes.
3) Oh, and you definitely ought to practice interviewing itself, discussing your merits and strengths. That is and forever will be a filter not just for interviews but within every job you have. To quote the inestimable Patrick McKenzie: "Status in well-run businesses generally is awarded to people who successfully take credit for [increasing profits or reducing costs].  (That can, but does not necessarily, entail actually doing them.)" https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/

If you have specific ideas about skills that fit into one of these filters of 1) job description skills, 2) interview skills, and 3) actual job skills, please [shoot me an email.](mailto:maxim.efremov@gmail.com)
